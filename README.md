## Abstract 
Forests across the Pacific Northwest experienced a global change-type hot drought during the summer of 2015. This extreme event led to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mortality in the McDonald and Dunn Research Forests. In response, silviculturists cleared the stands of the drought-damaged trees based on visual indicators of physiological characteristics, yet trees continued to die after drought thinning. Why did some individuals that were impacted by the same drought and growing conditions survive when others continued to die over the following four years? What are the physiological differences between the trees that died and the ones that survived the hot drought? Could these physiological differences serve as a survivability indicator for future hot droughts? Our first hypothesis is that there is a relationship among growth variations, intrinsic water-use efficiency, and drought survivability because water availability impacts the rate of carbon fixation and transpiration. Our second hypothesis is that there is a relationship between growth variations and hyperspectral reflectance as reflectance captures aspects of wood properties that result from tree responses to drought. Our third hypothesis is that there is a relationship between tree-ring stable carbon isotope composition and hyperspectral reflectance as reflectance captures structural and chemical features of wood impacted by primary leaf-level metabolism, independent from the relationship between reflectance and growth variations. 

      Physiological states will be determined by measuring tree-ring width index (RWI), basal area increment (BAI), stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C), and hyperspectral reflectance in the 900-1700 nm range. Tree-ring width index and basal area increment will specify annual differences in tree growth. We will measure the δ13C of tree rings across years between drought-killed and drought-surviving trees. Tree-ring whole wood stable isotope composition can detect physiological (i.e., photosynthetic assimilation relative to stomatal conductance) responses to previous climatic events. Because isotope analysis is both costly and time consuming, we will compare isotope composition to hyperspectral reflectance data from the same tree cores to assess whether reflectance data can serve as a proxy for δ13C and also reveal new information about tree growth responses to climate variation. Scanning tree cores with a hyperspectral camera could provide forest managers with a less costly and time-consuming assessment of tree physiological states and climate responses
